### Getting Started:

**About the repository:**

- This repository implements a **"monorepo"** arquitecture using **pnpm workspaces**.
- There are currently two "apps" inside the monorepo:
  - **Core:** Main business logic of the plugin that runs outside of the UI context (aka the "back-end" of the plugin).
  - **UI:** The plugin UI that the user interacts with. (aka the "front-end" of the plugin).

**Available Commands:**

- Generic:

  - Installing dependencies:

    ```
    pnpm install
    ```

  - Starting the "dev servers":

    ```
    pnpm dev
    ```

  - Build the plugin:

    ```
    pnpm build
    ```

- Targeting a specific app or package:
  - Starting the "dev server" of UI app only:
    ```
    pnpm ui:dev
    ```
  - Building the UI app only:
    ```
    pnpm ui:build
    ```
    **Note:** Pnpm allows to run any scripts defined in the package.json of the packages matched by pnpm-workspace.yaml file. You can run these scripts with the command: `pnpm --filter <package_name> <script>`.
